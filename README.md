# ATSimulatorTools

## Introduction

ATSimulatorTools is a package that can help you manage your simulator.
If you write tests, especially integration tests, you probably bumped into issues with permissions.
For example, you want to sync your data with the calendar or the reminders app, but you need to grant permissions.

With ATSimulatorTools, that can be achieved with only one line of code.
